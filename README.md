# Measuree

## Task

> The goal of the application is to have some working code that can be presented in front
of the development team. In order to do so, we are going to ask for a very simple app
that has a backend and client with an emphasis on quality. Feel free to use whatever
tools you feel more comfortable with for the frontend and the backend but those must be
separated (single page application). Extra points if the tool can be easily run in our
machines.
> We want a Frontend + Backend application that allows you to post and visualise
metrics. Each metric will have: Timestamp, name, and value. The metrics will be shown
in a timeline and must show averages per minute/hour/day The metrics will be persisted
in the database.
